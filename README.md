InstaBot is an instagram bot to add likes and comments automatically. It is also possible to follow or unfollow different users.
Users are saved in follower_InstaBot and follower_history_InstaBot files.
First file is blanked when unfollow command is sent.
Second file is never blanked since it is useful to check if user has ever been followed and never do it again.
